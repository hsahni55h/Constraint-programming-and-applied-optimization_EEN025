Fiat has decided to allocate part of last year’s revenues W into opening some new retailers in Puglia.
Preliminary studies helped find a set of possible locations I. Opening a retailer at the location i comes with a
fixed cost F_i (purchase the land, pay administrative costs,…) and a variable cost C_i based on the retailer size,
measured in hundreds of square meters. For each location the retailer centre has a minimum size L_i and
maximum one U_i . 
Once it is open, each retailer is expected to produce revenues R_i based on its size (again
measured in hundreds of square meters). Determine the set of locations to open new retail centres and their
size in order to maximize the revenues, keeping in mind that not more that K centres can be open.

***In this task no actual data is given, therefore the model has to be formulated as a function of the given
sets and parameters. ***
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

let, x_i = 1, if a center is opened otherwise x_i = 0

revenue from last year = W
maximum number of centers possible = K
possible locations = I
fixed cost = F_i
Variable cost = C_i
Minimum size of center = L_i
Maximum size of center = U_i

Expected revenue from centers = R_i (depends on the size of the center)

Constraint_1:
-------------

let s_i denote the size of the center i such that

==>     L_i*x_i <= s_i <= U_i * x_i, for all i∈I

Constraint_2:
-------------

==>     ∑x_i <= K, for all i∈
All possible open centers should not exceed the maximum allowed


Constraint_3:
-------------


The cost of openeing the centers should not be more than W

==>     ∑(F_i * x_i) + ∑(C_i * s_i * x_i) <= W, for all i∈I


Objective Function:
-------------------

revenue should be maximized

==>        max(∑(R_i * s_i * x_i)), for all i∈I
